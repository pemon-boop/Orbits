focus more on dep date
future time windows for dep date (2029)

change time window to future (2029) -- estimate launch date
solve earth to mars transfer
	launch b/w Aug 1, 2028 - Dec 31, 2029
	must launch and arrive within this window
	more realistic simulation
	porkchop plot
	launch date, tof, delta-v

hitch ride? -- choose orbit for s/c
singel s/c
revisit specific region
circular orbit

talk to mars orbiter

near geseret crater on mars
research mars orbiter orbit
how often does it rotate mars, how fast
when to communicate w mars orbiter

research orbital revisit

maximize revisit

presentation, 1 for each

presentation for porkchop plot
table for each:
5 optimal delta-v dates
5 optimal TOF dates

generate revisit orbit for CAL POLY SLO CAMPUS (lat and long)
inputs: LAT LONG, D, N 
how to find a, i, RAAN? refer to paper
use J2 prop -> prop for 1 cycle
are we passing thru Cal Poly SLO campus? 
want to validate orbit -> groundtrack plot

input parameer local time at ascending node calc raan from this 
polyspace > sun-sync orbit > orbit design > INPUT LOCAL TIME TO RAAN use that function to convert 
J2 must be an input

start getting polyspaace github onto laptop + desktop
create a branch and work from that
create a folder for all astrodynamics things
